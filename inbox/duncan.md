# Random notes: 




# Wiki ideas: 

- general noob notes
  - code in the docker instance changes when you switch git branches
- rails for noobs
  - popups come from optimiser called bullet, You can shut it of by creating a file called `.env.development.local` under `WcaOnRails` with the following contents: `DISABLE_BULLET=true`
- project management section
  ? where to create this? it's own file? inside wst-internal? 
- using the dev server
  - log in to anyone's account by using WCA ID as email, and "wca" as password 
  - DATABASE
    - you don't start off with any data from the database. This command downloads the latest dev db export: 
      - `bin/rake db:load:development`
    - this command takes a long time (70 minutes)
- staging
  - database has to be manually updated
- statistics 
  - updates twice per week

- common email queries

- Importing Registration Data
  - Import CSV format is the same as the format of the CSV you get when exporting registration data fro a competition

  - TODO: make a list of field names and input requirements
